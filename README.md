# Crime-Analytics

Crime analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding societal challenges, particularly in India, where murder
statistics reflect complex patterns of violence and public safety concerns. The advent of data analytics has
enabled researchers to extract actionable insights from crime datasets, informing policy decisions and resource
allocation. This project analyzes a dataset of murder victims in India from 2001 to 2010, sourced from Kaggle,
which details victim counts across states, years, genders, and age groups. By integrating data cleaning,
exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning, we aim to uncover trends and develop predictive models
to enhance crime analysis.
