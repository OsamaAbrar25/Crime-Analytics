# Crime-Analytics

Crime analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding societal challenges, particularly in India, where murder
statistics reflect complex patterns of violence and public safety concerns. The advent of data analytics has
enabled researchers to extract actionable insights from crime datasets, informing policy decisions and resource
allocation. This project analyzes a dataset of murder victims in India from 2001 to 2010, sourced from Kaggle,
which details victim counts across states, years, genders, and age groups. By integrating data cleaning,
exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning, we aim to uncover trends and develop predictive models
to enhance crime analysis.

ðŸ‘‰ I cleaned the data: Imputed NULL with zeros and dropped redundant columns for accuracy. <br>
ðŸ‘‰ I explored patterns: Found 32,000 yearly victims, with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar leading (70% of cases).<br>
ðŸ‘‰ I uncovered trends (EDA): Noted a 2:1 male-to-female ratio and 18â€“30 age group dominance (40%).<br>
ðŸ‘‰ I applied ML models: Achieved 98.55% accuracy with Random Forest and 83.12% R-squared with SVR.<br>
ðŸ‘‰ I visualized results: Plotted matrices and scatters, showing minimal errors.<br>
